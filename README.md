# Sappho
Sappho is a simple Package Manager, that works on Linux and - might - work on Windows.

I did not compile it, so you might have to do it yourself. Once you do, you can install Programs as easy as this

  sappho -S [Package Name]

-S is short for "Synchronize". This will automatically download the latest release of a program.
